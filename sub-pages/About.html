    <p> 
        This website is reffering to the short story "To serve the Master" and how
        Applequist gives part to the robot for it to be able to function <br>

        This game will make you bring the given part to the robot and make you choose which
        ending you will prefer( if you think that the humans were right or if the android was right).
